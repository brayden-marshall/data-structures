# DATA STRUCTURES

## TODO

- Create a Makefile setup for running tests/benchmarks, compiling, etc.
- Convert LinkedList and BST to use unique_ptr/shared_ptr rather than raw 'new' and 'delete'

## Testing

Catch2 C++ unit-test framework: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2

Tests can be running using the script `run_tests.py` which will compile 
and run all files with the form `tests/.*tests.cc`
